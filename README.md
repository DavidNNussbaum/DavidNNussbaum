Hi. I'm David Nussbaum, a software engineer who has the goal of working with companies to improve their interactions with patients, doctors, and other medical-related entities. In this role, I would be an active member of a programming team that designs sites which allow for medical input and/or provides pertinent medical data.

My experience includes having been practicing as a board-certified podiatrist which has included all aspects of podiatry both in the office as well as serving hospital inpatients. During the last four years I have learned Python programming and have become a Python Institute certified programmer. One of my accomplishments was the creation of coding to predict which patients have a greater chance of developing ulcers, both with Keras and with various classifiers including two ensemble models.

My spoken languages include English and Hebrew with a limited knowledge of Spanish.
If there are any questions or comments, feel free to contact me at davidnnussbaum@gmail.com.
